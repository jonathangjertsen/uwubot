# uwubot

Reads tweets from a victim account, does some string manipulation to make it sound extremely stupid, and tweets the result

# Setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up a developer account and create a file called `secrets.json` with credentials:

```
{
    "consumer_key": "",
    "consumer_key_secret": "",
    "bearer_token": "",
    "access_token": "",
    "access_token_secret": ""
}
```

# Example session

Run the script with `-v` set to the username of the victim.
You will be presented with the original and fucked up versions of each tweet.
To send the tweet you must write "yes" in response to the "Approve?" prompt.

```
$ python uwubot.py -v realDonaldTrump
